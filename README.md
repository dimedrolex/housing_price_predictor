The project utilizes Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and sklearn to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the California housing dataset.

It begins by loading and exploring the dataset, visualizing key relationships between features using Seaborn and Matplotlib. The project further implements a Linear Regression model from sklearn to predict housing prices based on various features like median income, housing age, and room statistics. The model's performance is evaluated using mean squared error, and a scatter plot visually compares the predicted housing prices against the actual values.

Overall, this project offers an end-to-end demonstration of data analysis, visualization, and machine learning for predicting housing prices based on California housing data.
